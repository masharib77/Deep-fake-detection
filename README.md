Deep Fake Detection using Vision Transformer and Neural Network 

Hello peeps!!

you can download the dataset from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection
if you want to run and train the data by yourself it's better to use the saved model because it takes a lot of your time in training the model

Or you can just predict the images using our my pre saved model from (deepfakemodel.h5)
and just give the path to your image to start predicting
